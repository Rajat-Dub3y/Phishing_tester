# 🔐 Phishing Tester:

A Machine Learning–based web application that detects whether a given URL is phishing or legitimate using extracted structural features.

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of cybersecurity concepts combined with supervised machine learning and web deployment.

Features :

Cybersecurity learning project
Academic machine learning demonstration
Real-Time URL Analysis
User-Friendly Web Interface
Deployment Ready

FOLDER STRUCTURE :


Tech Stack :

Python
TypeScript
CSS 

Getting Started :

	🧠 How It Works

		1. User enters a URL into the web interface.
		2. The system extracts relevant structural features from the URL.
		3. The trained machine learning model processes these features.
		4. The model predicts:
   			- ✅ Legitimate
  			- ⚠️ Phishing

	The detection is based on URL characteristics such as:
		- URL length
		- Presence of special characters
		- Number of subdomains
		- Suspicious patterns
		- HTTPS usage

	Installation

		Clone the Repository

			git clone https://github.com/Rajat-Dub3y/Phishing_tester.git
